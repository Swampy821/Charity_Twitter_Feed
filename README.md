# Charity_Twitter_Feed
This is an open source twitter feed screen. 

I had a real difficult time finding a decent one with an approval process that would actually donate and not expect $$$ so I created my own to be used at charity events. 

It is a work in progress but will be in working condition by May 2nd, 2015.

If anyone would like to donate to our current Relay for Life event, any donation would be greatly appreciated
